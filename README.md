# Escape-the-arcade
Web game made with Phaser and HTML for the Web Development subject at Jaume I University. The instructions for this project
were having three minigames inside a game:
  1. Avoid projectiles
  2. Type names
  3. Limited jumps

The main character enters an arcade and the world becomes the game itself.

To play the game, the index file must be opened some sort of live server extension. VSCode Live Server extension works perfectly
for this.
